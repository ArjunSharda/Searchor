Searchor uses Python classes, and the `urllib.parse` quote library, with other libraries such as
`aenum`,
`click`,
`requests`,
and `pyperclip`
to function.

These libraries are important for Searchor as if Searchor develops its own capabilities to function, it would be more harder for contributing, and integration, as well. With minimal libraries, Searchor also has it's own capabilities with common uses such as web development pairing with a framework such as Django.
